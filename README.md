# M1-Android-TP2

Practical work for an Android Devlopment class.

The `TP2` folder corresponds to the first part of the subject, and the `Flickrapp` one to the second part.

## Using both projects

For `TP2` folder, you only have to open the project in Android Studio.

For `Flickrapp`, you first need to open the project in Android Studio. Then edit the file `Flickrapp\app\src\main\res\values\secrets.xml`to add you consumer key and secret key. No API keys are provided in these project to prevent anyone to stole them.
